          <h5>My Brief Story</h5>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
          I come from China and currently living and working in Tokyo. Since I was little, I've been crazily fascinated with computer. During college, I tried my best to get in touch with any resources about Internet and web development, even though my major is "Business and Commerce". Because I know, my passion for life never stops me from trying anything new.
          <br>
          <br>
          After graduate from college, I started working as a book-keeper in an accounting firm. It brought me nothing but static numerics. I know what I am looking for and passionate about, so I quit my first company and joined an IT company as a developer.
          <br>
          <br>
          However, many concerns came out right after I became an programmer. What I learned in college is apparently insufficient to support me in this field especially when programming needs me to be good at algorithms and mathematics. I think the only reason why I devote myself into this "world" is that I love mathematics and solving practical problems with it. In 2015, since I've already noticed what I am short for, I decided to restart my "college life" again studying everything about computers. What's funny is my peasant-level salary could never allow me to spend extra money on things other than living. But I insisted to buy a lot of educational materials which almost made me broke that period of time. Just with that "stupid" decision I imporved my skills and mind which would help me step up closer to science.
          <br>
          <br>
          I think this is exactly what people always talk about, "Find your passion and dive into it." I hope my choice is always the best one for me and will help contribute to make everyone's life beautiful.
